This is the main directory of the cac40 application.

Useful input data are kept in the data subdirectory.
The *.csv are comma separated values files used to populate the database
and allowing to test the application.

The *.db are the sqlite3 database files. The cac40.db is the main one.
Make sure to save a backup copy on a regular basis.
The content of the database can be displayed with sqlitebrowser.

The *.sql files are sets of SQL statements. The most important one is
create_cac.sql which can be used to recreate the database schema.

Template pages sent by the web server are stored in the html subdirectory.
The cascading style sheets are in the css subdir.

The *.py file are python scripts. The main one is escore.py which has to be
run regularly to get and store into the database the various scores generated
on the social network web pages.

All python scripts accept the -h option to print a brief help message.

cacdb.py may be used to print information about the content of the db.

reader.py takes a csv file and populates the db with its content.

fb_like.py is useful to test how to get the facebook scores.

tw_tweet.py is useful to test how to get the twitter scores.
These 2 last scripts do not modify the database.

server.py is a small http server used to display harvested data.
